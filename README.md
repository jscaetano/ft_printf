This a project called ft_printf for 42 School.
======

The goal is to recreate the behaviour of the printf function from libc.

The use of libft functions is allowed.

The function has to handle all cspdiuxX% conversions.

The library should be created using 'ar'. And a libftprintf.a should be created in the root of the repository.

This was the first introduction to passing a dynamic number of args in a function.

The full subject was added to the root of the repository.
